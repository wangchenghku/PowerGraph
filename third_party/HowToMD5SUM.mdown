# MD5SUM on Linux
## Check the iso file
### Manual method
First open a terminal and go to the correct directory to check a downloaded iso file:
```
    ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~$ cd Downloads
```
Then run the following command from within the download directory.
```
    md5sum ubuntu-11.10-dvd-i386.iso
```
**md5sum** should then print out a single line after calculating the hash:
```
    8044d756b7f00b695ab8dce07dce43e5 ubuntu-11.10-dvd-i386.iso
```
